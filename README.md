# About This Project
Probably one of my first projects in Unity. I developed the game for Android, and I worked on this game from 2017-2018 (when I was 15 until I was 16). It had a somewhat successful run on the android store, reaching a little over 100 free installs. I implemented ads, but at the time Slay the Spire had been released and I lost a lot of heart working on this beauty.
### Editor's Note: This game was intended to be play in PORTRAIT mode on a mobile device. It will look strange on landscape mode for PC.

# Highlights
* Combat: The combat in this game was card based, drawn at random and you could use action points to make attacks. Each attack had different effects, target types, and stat buffs.
* Shop: Every fight rewarded the player with coins, which they could use in shops to buy items and heal.
* Inventory: There was a simple card inventory, that you could use to set what cards would show up in fights. You could also select a bow, which does simple damage but different types had different stats that could find by clearing the game each time.
* Saving: The game used a terrible saving method of use Unity's PlayerPrefs to save all stats and the current level.
* Soundscape: This game used custom 8-bit sound effects for different attacks and damage. Added a little flavor to the game when playing.
* Level Design: Players would defeat enemies, and then choose a card for the path they would take. This would allow them to choose what enemies they might face, go to shops, and encounter the final boss.

# Insight On Drawbacks and Issues
* Spaghetti code: This was one of my first projects, so there is no doubt that every line of code would make a proper programmer question why I bothered touching a computer.
* Graphics design: I've gotten much better at pixel art over the years, but this was one of my first times making the art. I don't think it's inherently terrible, but all of the art was made before I knew any art design or rules for pixel art in general.
* Saving: Even at the time of making this, I knew what I was doing was frowned upon but I didn't understand the IO libaries in C#. I used PlayerPrefs (highly unstable and easily erased in Unity, about as stable and usable as a launcher's preferences being perserved) to save all of the player's game data.
* Very Old Game Now: This game is extremely old, made in Unity 5. There's probably no way to play the game without hours of work to repair it.

# Final Comments
I'll probably come back to get a working PC version of the game uploaded with the project, but as of now its off my computer and freeing up space for my other projects. It was extremely fun working on this, and was definitely my first stepping stone into programming as a whole. There are a lot things I wish I had done differently, but I suppose that comes with any project in hindsight.
